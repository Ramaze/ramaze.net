Ramaze User Guide
=================

Welcome to the user guide and thanks for flying with Ramaze. This guide aims to make it
as easy as possible for both newcomers and hardened veterans to find out more about 
Ramaze. If you've been using for Ramaze for a while you may remember the book 
"Journey to Ramaze". This is the old user guide and will be replaced by this one once it's
deemed complete enough to put online.

Building The Documentation
--------------------------

If you'd like to build a local copy of the documentation (useful when you're 
contributing to the guide) you can do so as following:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone git://github.com/Ramaze/ramaze-user-guide.git
  $ cd ramaze-user-guide
  $ make html

The result is an HTML version of the user guide which can be found in the directory 
build/html. For more information on all available build commands execute ``$ make``.

For more information about the coding standards and such see the file "README.md" in the
repository of this guide.
