Installation
=============

There are two ways of installing Ramaze, via RubyGems or using Git. If you're not 
interested in hacking with Ramaze or just want to quickly try it out using RubyGems is
the easiest way of installing Ramaze. Installing Ramaze using RubyGems only requires the
following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ gem install ramaze

On some systems you may need sudo permissions, in that case you'll have to execute the
following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo gem install ramaze

If you're running RVM this won't work, instead you'll have to execute the following 
command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ rvmsudo gem install ramaze

If you want to submit patches or simply want to use the bleeding edge of Ramaze it's best
to install it using Git. First make sure you're using a recent version of Git, you can
find your version by executing this command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git --version
  git version 1.7.1

Once you're running a recent version of Git (1.7 should be enough) you can clone a copy
of Ramaze by executing the git clone command as following:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone git://github.com/Ramaze/ramaze.git

This will create a directory called "ramaze" in the current directory. If you want to
rename the directory you can either modify the above command or use the mv command. Git
clone allows you to specify a custom directory name as following:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone git://github.com/Ramaze/ramaze.git custom-directory-name

Once you have a copy of Ramaze you can build the Gem by calling ``rake install``. Make sure
that you're in the actual directory otherwise Rake won't be able to find the Rakefile.

Example
-------

Imagine we're new to Ramaze and want to install it using Git. We'd do this as following:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone git://github.com/Ramaze/ramaze.git
  $ cd ramaze
  $ rake install

From this point on we can simply do ``require 'ramaze'`` and we're good to go.
