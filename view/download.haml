  ## gem

  The simplest way of installing Ramaze is to use the Rubygems package manager:

      $ gem install ramaze

  Then read [the getting started guide](http://ramaze.net:9998/Walkthrough).

  ## git

  To run the very latest development code, clone the git repository:

      $ git clone git://github.com/ramaze/ramaze.git

  Alternatively, install the gem from github.com:

      $ gem install --source http://gems.github.com manveru-ramaze

  Then make sure your local repo directory is in your $RUBYLIB path.  For example:

      # .bashrc or .zshrc
      export RUBYLIB="path/to/your/ramaze/lib/:$RUBYLIB"

  ## Windows Users
  Note: For Windows users, you may wish to install the win32console gem. This will both satisfy the warning generated by ramaze as well as give you pretty colors when you run your server.

      $ gem install win32console
