The Ramaze team is proud to announce the release of Ramaze version 2011.07.25.
This new release contains quite a few changes so it's best to read through them
carefully.

* `Ramaze::Log::RotatingInformer` can now be used as a Rack middleware.
* `Ramaze::Helper::Layout#set_layout` has been modified in such a way that it's
  easier to specify method specific layouts, see commit
  [0d15a29c960e22761456180a6be7b88c3809eba8][0d15a29c960e22761456180a6be7b88c3809eba8]
  or lib/ramaze/helper/layout.rb for more information.
* All remaining ETag issues have been solved.
* `Ramaze::Cache::Sequel` has been re-written, massive thanks to Lars Olsson for
  the contribution. See commit [c5587c0d3feda8ca2c89399418ac1132d0236fcb][c5587c0d3feda8ca2c89399418ac1132d0236fcb]
  or lib/ramaze/cache/sequel.rb for more information.
* `Ramaze::Cache::MemCache` has been re-written and now uses Dalli. See commit
  [016b2d225d601a71479698e40886b15aaeaa32ec][016b2d225d601a71479698e40886b15aaeaa32ec]
  or lib/ramaze/cache/memcache.rb for more information.
* Pathname errors have been resolved.
* The layout of the prototype has been updated to reflect the new design of the
  website.
* `Ramaze::Helper::BlueForm#input_checkbox` and
  `Ramaze::Helper::BlueForm#input_radio` now accept the options `:show_label`
  and `:show_value` which can be used to show/hide the values/labels of these
  methods.
* The Email contribution has been moved to Ramaze::Helper::Email and had
  several cleanups.
* The HTTP Digest helper has been removed in favor of Rack::Auth.
* User objects are no longer stored in the session when using
  `Ramaze::Helper::User`, it may not always be possible to Marshal these
  objects.
* Several changes have been made for those developing Ramaze itself.
* A new shiny Ramaze executable, see commit
  [cd9fa64138324a5af061daafbd8e7307726843ed][cd9fa64138324a5af061daafbd8e7307726843ed]
  or the files in lib/ramaze/bin/ for more information.
* `Ramaze::View::Less`, `Ramaze::View::RedCloth` and `Ramaze::View::Maruku`
  have been removed. Less is no longer supported without Node.js, RedCloth
  could not be compiled on systems running relatively new versions of GCC. On
  top of that both RedCloth and Maruku weren't used as view drivers.
* `Ramaze::Helper::BlueForm#input_checkbox` and
  `Ramaze::Helper::BlueForm#input_radio` no longer generate a hidden field as
  this would generate Rack errors (they also weren't that useful).
* General code cleanups and more documentation.

The user guide will be updated in the coming days to reflect these changes. If
you have anything to add yourself feel free to submit a pull request and we'll
take a look at it.

Happy hacking!
