This release is a relatively small release containing only a few changes:

* Ramaze has been updated to work with the newest version(s) of Rack as 1.4
  introduced a few changes related to dealing with static files.
* A few variables that were shadowed by other variables have been renamed.
* A few small changes to the documentation.
* The CSRF helper now uses request.ip/request.host instead of directly using
  request.env. The latter would cause issues when proxying requests to Ramaze
  (e.g. when running it on Heroku).

Innate has also been updated (new version is 2011.12) to work with Rack 1.4.
Because of the changes in Rack Ramaze 2011.12.28 requires Innate 2011.12 or
greater.
