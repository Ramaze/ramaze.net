  Ramaze is a very simple and straight-forward web-framework.

  title: ORMs
  content: >
    Ramaze works with any ORM and database toolkit.  Sequel, Datamapper or
    M4DBI; the choice is all yours. If there is a database toolkit that somehow
    doesn't work feel free to report an issue and it will be fixed.

  title: Template Engines
  content: >
    There are <em>a lot</em> of template engines available for Ruby. Tenjin,
    Liquid, ERB and so on. Just like ORMs Ramaze has support for a wide range
    of template engines and if your engine isn't supported it's very easy to
    create an adapter for it.

  title: Rubies
  content: >
    Ramaze can run on MRI, 1.9, Rubinus and JRuby. Odds are that if your Ruby
    installation works in a similar way such as MRI and 1.9 it will be able to
    run Ramaze.

  title: Adapters
  content: >
    Thin, Unicorn or Passenger, as long as your webserver/adapter supports Rack
    it will be able to run Ramaze just fine. Ramaze also comes with WEBRick to
    make the development process even easier.
