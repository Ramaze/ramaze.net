Ramaze is a very simple and straight-forward web-framework. The philosophy of
it could be expressed in a mix of KISS and POLS, trying to make simple things
simple and complex things possible and fun.

Installing and running Ramaze is as simple as the following commands:

    #!text
    $ gem install ramaze
    $ ramaze create blog
    $ cd blog
    $ rake ramaze:start
