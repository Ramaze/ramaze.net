  title: Mailing List
  content: >
    Ramaze used Google Groups to host its
    <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ramaze">mailing list</a>.
    The mailing list is the main source of answers for almost all your
    questions and usually it doesn't take too long before you'll get a reply
    from one of the members.

    Ramaze has its own IRC channel, #ramaze, on Freenode. The IRC channel is
    perfect if you're in a hurry and need an answer quickly or just want to
    chat with other Ramaze users.

    Although it's recommended to use the mailing list, most of our members
