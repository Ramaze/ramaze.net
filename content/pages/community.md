The Ramaze community is a friendly group of people that are always willing to
help and have plenty of knowledge about both Ramaze as well as Ruby itself.

Whether you're having a problem with a view or you're trying to pitch an idea
of something you're interested in building with Ramaze, we'll help you out as
much as we can.
